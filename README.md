# HOSTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This MERN stack-based full stack app aims to minimize paper usage in SSN College's ladies hostel. It automates the process of booking rooms and requesting outpasses, addressing issues like  lack of reliable room availability details and reservations for international students. It provides a sustainable alternative to physical outpass filing, reducing paper waste.
