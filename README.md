# HOSTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The MERN stack-based full stack app aimed to minimize paper usage in SSN College's ladies hostel. It automated room booking and outpass requests, addressing issues like room availability details and reservations for international students. It provided a sustainable alternative to physical outpass filing, reducing paper waste.
